## RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE
 
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares marked by numbers from 1 to 9
 
2. The first player is X, the second one is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares typing in a number of the square they choose.
 
3. The first player who gets 3 of his/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
 
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
